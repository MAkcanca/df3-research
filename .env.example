# In our tests, we only used OPENAI key and OPENROUTER key, rest is not needed unless you are using direct providers.
# Openrouter and openai uses the openai api schemas so they work interchangeably but we are using different keys for
# ease of access. Also most of the local LLMs use the same schemes anyway so we are good.
